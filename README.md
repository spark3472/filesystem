<h2> Overview of File System </h2>

Our file system is very similar to the Linux inode structure from HW6. We have an inode region where each inode points to its data blocks using direct and indirect blocks. The data region is directly after the inode region. The root directory is inode 0. The data blocks of directories hold a linked list of directory entries for everything inside of it, which includes the children’s name, inode number, and pointer to its next sibling. Above the physical file system, we use vnodes to track the open file and directory trees. The vnode holds a link to “next”, its next sibling, and “child”, its first child entry. It also holds the name, inode number, chmod and read/write permissions, and type (file/directory/etc). The file/directory trees are structured as linked lists of file entries and directories entries, each of which hold a vnode and an indicator for offset within the file/directory. When a file/directory is made, it is added as a child on the vnode and as an entry on the tree. When a file/directory is removed, it is removed as a child on the vnode and as an entry on the tree. When a file/directory is closed, it is only removed as an entry on the tree. When a file/directory is opened, it is added as an entry on the tree.

The list of free inodes is a linked list with each free inode pointing to the next one. The list of free blocks is the same, with the pointer to the next one in the first four bytes of the data. Freed inodes and blocks are added to the head of the linked list.


<h3>Data Structures</h3>
arrays: to keep track of the file table and the directory table <br >
vnode: linked list where it stores it's children but also a sibling <br >
Testing for:
    - file to mount doesn't exist
    - file to open doesn't exist
    - file to read doesn't exist


<h2> Disk Format </h2>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Fully Implemented</h3>
<h4>Virtual File System</h4>
<h5>f_open</h5>
open the specified file with the specified access (read, write, read/write, append). If the file does not exist, handle accordingly. (rule of thumb: create file if writing/appending, return error if reading is involved). Returns a file handle if successful <br >
<h5>f_read</h5>
read the specified number of bytes from a file handle at the current position. Returns the number of bytes read, or an error. <br >
<h5>f_write</h5>
write some bytes to a file handle at the current position. Returns the number of bytes written, or an error. <br >
<h5>f_close</h5>
close a file handle <br >
<h5>f_seek</h5>
move to a specified position in a file
<h5>f_rewind</h5>
move to the start of the file
<h5>f_stat</h5>
retrieve information about a file
<h5>f_remove</h5> 
delete a file
<h5>f_opendir</h5>
recall that directories are handled as special cases of files. open a “directory file” for reading, and return a directory handle.
<h5>f_readdir</h5> 
returns a pointer to a “directory entry” structure representing the next directory entry in the directory file specified.
<h5>f_closedir</h5> 
close an open directory file
<h5>f_mkdir</h5>
make a new directory at the specified location
<h5>f_rmdir</h5>
delete a specified directory. Be sure to remove entire contents and the contents of all subdirectories from the filesystem. Do NOT simply remove pointers to directory.
<h5>f_mount</h5>
mount a specified file system into your directory tree at a specified location. (cannot mount more than one disk)
<h5>f_umount</h5>
unmount a specified file system
 
<h4>Shell</h4>
<h5>cd</h5>
Moves up/down the directory tree, supports . and ..
<h5>pwd</h5>
Yes
<h5>cat</h5>
Prints the contents of a file
<h5>more</h5>
Prints the contents of a file one page at a time


<h3>Partially Implemented</h3>
<h5>chmod</h5>
change_chmod() in vfs.c changes the permissions for a file or directory, but not integreated with shell.

<h5>rm</h5>
Removes a file or directory (with -r flag) - buggy, especially with removing directories. Sometimes it doesn't remove the directory, or also removes everything in the parent directory
<h5>rmdir</h5>
Removes a directory (calls rm with -r)
<h5>redirection</h5>
Sometimes the file isn't created, specifically in sub-directories or if there are directories first as children
<h5>mkdir</h5>
Sometimes the directory isn't created, or creates infinite sub-directories of itself
<h5>ls</h5>
No flags supported




<h3>Not Implemented</h3>
<h5>ls with flags</h5>
<h5>mount in shell</h5>
<h5>unmount in shell</h5>
<h5>symbolic chmod</h5>

<h3>Known Bugs and Limitations</h3>
Does not support indirect blocks.
Chmod is absolute only.
Creation of directories and files is buggy (see above)


<h2>Testing<h2>
To test, we created a few test programs for the file system (submitted with them). We also used the main function in the vfs.c to test each feature as it was created. For the shell, we used a variety of calls, like the set of ones given in the slack, in various combos to see if any recent changes affected the functionality of a previous feature.
